    <h2>Why I want to learn programming</h2>
    <p>I use sap and some other financial systems every day in my daily life and I would like to know how they work. At the same time, I think that only a small amount of accounting will be used in the future, and the basic accounting work will be replaced by computers. I want to be a person who cannot be replaced by computers. Of course, the most important thing is that I have always had a strong interest in computers. I want to learn the realization of software, the construction of web pages, and the interconnection of networks.</p>
